    <p>What is it a strange word? Macaroon. It seems that it has appeared recently and belongs to these modern words. But it is not true.

The macaroon is a soft cake of rounded shape that people have tasted since the middle Ages. It has from 3 to 5 cm in diameter. The macaroon recipe varies by the cook’s skills. Professionals cook more complicated recipes, but housewives can try to cook light variant of them.

Indeed, the preparation and cooking of macaroons is difficult even for professionals. To make a traditional macaroon, you need almond powder, icing sugar, sugar and egg whites. The amount of almond is equal to the amount of icing sugar.

The macaroon has different flavors and colors. Generally, the pink macaroon is made with strawberry or raspberry. The beige macaroon has vanilla flavor. The brown macaroon is made of chocolate or coffee. The yellow macaroon is made with lemon.

Recently it has been cooked a special macaroon which has two flavors. The ‘body’ and the ‘heart’ are different. For example, pear-orange and cherry-apple macaroons are very popular.</p>
